Since people don't read the modding docs here's what the most common this.options and what the do (also read the modding docs) 
  map_name: "Dueling", //Map name, i don't think there's a limit unlike the standard custom game creater but keep the name simple so people can read it

  ships: adminTools,  //this is from the dueling mod but in the dueling mod this is how more ships are added
